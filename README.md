# Titanic Data Analysis

## Overview
The Titanic Data Analysis repository contains exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and insights derived from the Titanic dataset. This classic dataset is used to illustrate various data analysis techniques and is particularly popular in machine learning training.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains all datasets used in the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis steps.
- **images/**: Contains all visual aids used in the analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MurtazaMajid/Titanic-Data-Analysis.git
cd Titanic-Data-Analysis
```

## Data Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `PassengerId`: An unique identifier for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger in years.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Analysis
In this repository, we explore various data cleaning techniques, statistical analyses, and different visualizations to uncover insights related to the Titanic disaster.

### Key Findings
- Women and children had a higher survival rate compared to men.
- Passengers in higher classes had a better chance of survival.
