# Titanic Data Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains data about the passengers, including their demographics, ticket information, and whether or not they survived the disaster.

## Introduction
The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaggle and includes the following columns:
- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

### Key Visualizations

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. Further analysis could explore machine learning models to predict survival based on the available data.
